# miniblog-ng

This is a simple mini blogger app which takes from my earlier project "TestProject02" and will further develop it by adding ngRoutes and updating various features. This project is an exercise to practice developing with AngularJS. While TestProject02 was a test to develop the app within 48 hours, this project has no time limit, and will evolve as I learn how to use more methods in creating a single page app.

<ol>To load the app:
<li>Clone the repository (Can click "Clone in Desktop")</li>
<li>in terminal, type "cd miniblog-ng" to navigate to the root folder</li>
<li>then type "node server" to start the local server</li>
<li>in browser, go to "localhost:8000/app/index.html" to view the app</li>
</ol>

Directory to the app:
/miniblog-ng/app/index.html

Custom css attributes outside of bootstrap are stored in custom.css found in:
/miniblog-ng/app/css

Code files for angular app, controllers, services, and directories are in:
/miniblog-ng/app/js

The app uses 2 json files. One to populate the page with posts called posts.json and one for the about section called pages.json. Both are stored in:
/miniblog-ng/app/json

The html code for the navigation bar is stored in the partials folder:
/miniblog-ng/app/partials

Html code for posts and pages views are in:
/miniblog-ng/app/views
